## Into To TypeSript

- before going to learn about typescript we must need about javascript
- because
  [![superset of js and TypeScript](https://i.postimg.cc/pTRHwCF5/shapes-at-24-06-03-13-13-05.png)](https://postimg.cc/8FK9WhwT)
- `TypeScript` is superset of `JavaScript`.

- everything in `JavaScript` that we can do `JavaScript` that is alreday available in `TypeScript` and lot more available .
- it allow to write `js` more precise manner so our code face less error.
- lastly all `TypeScript` convert into `js` than run that js code .
- `TypeScript` give code type safety .
  but from where type safety

```js
2 + "2";
null + 2;
undefined + 2;

// this is typescript this is not allow
```

1. what typescript does

- static checking (variable datatype)
- analyze the code and give hint about error code

- in TypeScript we write more code than `js` and that TypeScript code convert into `js` code
- `TypeScript` is a development tool , it a just a layer on `js`

- here is the example of ts code convert into js and so error with ts code

- in above img we decalre a just `user` object and it have two property `name` and `age` and try to access the email which is not available in user object and `ts` transpiler just giver mark error but code still convert into js

```ts
let num1 = 12;
let num2 = "12";
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum); //OUTPUT 1212
```

- converted js code

```js
"use strict";
let num1 = 12;
let num2 = "12";
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum); //OUTPUT 1212
```

- here both number have differnt data type but we can still addition no one can stop

## installtion of ts

1. global installtion

- core installtion

```
npm install -g typescript
```

and for converting ts code into js

```cmd
tsc <path-to-the-file>
```

- and secondly we can setup or installtion

## Types In TS

- primitives

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. null
5. undefined
6. Void
7. Object
8. Array
9. Tuples
   .....

- and many more

- don't use anywhere in ts code here we are miss using ts  
  `any` , `never` , `unknown`

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
  if (typeof num1 == "number" && typeof num2 == "number") {
    return num1 + num2;
  } else {
    throw "Type miss match";
  }
}
```

```ts
function add(num1: number, num2: number): number {
  return num1 + num2;
}
add(1, 2);
```

## variable

```
let/var/const <variableName>:<type> = value(optional);
```

```ts
let myName: string = "Utsav"; // now only suggest string methods

let num = 12; // let num: number = 12;

let isMale = true;
```

- every time we don't need to define the type of the variable , ts transpiler or compiler can automatic deteact the type of the data ðŸ˜Š

## Any

- we have variable and we dont have any idea of which type of the variable
  `let hero;`
- here ts transpiler set hero type as any and we can do anything with this variable like we do in js

- better way

```ts
let hero: string;
function getHero() {
  return "Thor";
  // return true; // give error
}
hero = getHero();
```

- `any` is a not a special type a it is a just marker for not checking type of the variable

> When you donâ€™t specify a type, and TypeScript canâ€™t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to any.

> You usually want to avoid this, though, because any isnâ€™t type-checked. Use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit any as an error.
